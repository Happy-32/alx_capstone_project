    <!-- some features and functionality -->
    The project contains a feature that allows the user to change themes as and when they want to.
    It offers a variety of theme colors for the users and it also saves the chosen theme for the next vist

    The website also contains a contact form which allows users to reach out to me with any questions or suggestions. The form is validated using javascript. That means the user will not be able to submit the form without properly filling out all the required fields.
    The email is aalso validated which means the email the user enters must be in the standard email format "name@email.com" or they will not be able to submit the form

Technologies used:
    HTML: For the base structure of the website
    CSS: For adding styles to the webpage to make it look nice.
    JavaScript: For validating the email and the entire form and also to enable the switching
                of themes from one color to another and to save it in the localstorage for the next visit
